<div class="brutal-box-green">
**OVERVIEW**

For this assessment, I extensively used **Claude (by Anthropic)** as my GenAI tool to help build this Quarto website. This is my reflection on the problems I encountered and thoughts on how GenAI will shape my future work.

## CHOICE OF GENAI TOOL

<div class="brutal-box">
**WHY CLAUDE?**

I chose **Claude** (via claude.ai) as my main GenAI assistant for several compelling reasons:

— **Strong Coding Capabilities:** Best-in-class coding abilities among available GenAI tools

— **Long Context Window:** Handles extended conversations with excellent memory retention

I also occasionally used **ChatGPT** and **Gemini**, but Claude was my primary development assistant.

## HOW GENAI HELPED ME

<div class="brutal-box-pink">
**HTML/CSS STYLING ISSUES**

**Challenge:** HTML and CSS have been challenging for me in the past. Although not inherently difficult, getting the layout and styling right requires significant time for research and testing.

**How Claude helped:**

— Quickly transformed my ideas into working HTML/CSS snippets

— Enabled rapid iteration through simple modification requests

**Example transformation:**
```html
<!-- This didn't work -->
<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="image.jpg" style="width: 250px;">
</div>

<!-- Claude suggested this -->
![](image.jpg){width=250px style="..."}
```
</div>

## BENEFITS VS CHALLENGES

<div class="two-column">

<div>
<h3>BENEFITS</h3>

<div class="brutal-box-green">
**FASTER PROBLEM-SOLVING**

Instead of searching through documentation and Stack Overflow, Claude provided direct answers, saving significant development time and reducing context switching.
</div>

<div class="brutal-box-green">
**LEARNING WHILE DOING**

Claude didn't just provide code - it explained concepts and reasoning, turning problem-solving into a learning opportunity.
</div>

<div class="brutal-box-green">
**ERROR DEBUGGING**

Error debugging was always challenging for me. Claude helped identify and fix errors quickly, explaining the root causes along the way.
</div>
</div>

<div>
<h3>CHALLENGES</h3>

<div class="brutal-box-pink">
**NOT ALWAYS CORRECT ON FIRST TRY**

Some issues, like HTML rendering problems, required multiple iterations. Claude's first suggestion didn't always work, necessitating several alternative approaches.
</div>

<div class="brutal-box-pink">
**CONTEXT LIMITATIONS**

In longer conversations, Claude occasionally forgot earlier context or provided contradictory information that conflicted with previous suggestions.
</div>

<div class="brutal-box-pink">
**OVER-COMPLICATED SOLUTIONS**

Sometimes Claude over-engineered simple problems. For example, requesting a simple layout change resulted in an unnecessarily complex CSS grid solution.

<div class="brutal-box-green">
**FINAL REFLECTION**

GenAI tools like Claude have fundamentally changed my development workflow. While they're not perfect, the productivity gains and learning acceleration make them invaluable companions in software engineering education and practice. The key is understanding their limitations and using them as intelligent assistants rather than infallible oracles.

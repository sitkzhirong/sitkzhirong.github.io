title: "Reflection on the use of GenAI"

## Introduction

For this assessment, I extensively used **Claude (by Anthropic)** as GenAI tool to help build this Quarto website. This reflection on the problems I encountered, and thoughts on how GenAI will shape my future work.

## Choice of GenAI Tool

### Why Claude?

I chose **Claude** (via claude.ai) as my main GenAI assistant for few reasons:

1. **Strong coding capabilities**: From my expereience if have the best coding capabilities among available GenAI tools
2. **Long context window**: Can handle long conversation with good memory of my past inputs

I also occasionally used **ChatGPT** and **Gemini** , but Claude was my main tool.

## How GenAI Helped Me

### 1. HTML/CSS Styling Issues

**Challenge**: HTML and CCS has been a hasel to me in the past, and I struggled to get the layout and styling right for my Quarto site. Although it is not difficult it would require time to research and test.

**How Claude helped**:
- Quickly able to bring my idea to life with working HTML/CSS snippets
- Able to iterate rapidly by asking for modifications

**Example transformation**:
```html
<!-- This didn't work -->
<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="image.jpg" style="width: 250px;">
</div>

<!-- Claude suggested this -->
![](image.jpg){width=250px style="..."}
```

## Benefits of Using GenAI

### 1. **Faster Problem-Solving**
Instead of searching through the web and stackoverflow, it helpped saved me time by getting direct answers.

### 2. **Learning While Doing**
Claude didn't just give me code, it is able to explain concepts.

### 3. **Error Debugging**
Error debugging was always a problem for me. Claude helped me identify and fix errors quickly.

## Challenges of Using GenAI

### 1. **Not Always Correct on First Try**
The HTML rendering issue took multiple iterations to solve. Claude's first suggestion didn't work, and we had to try several approaches.

### 2. **Context Limitations**
Sometimes Claude forgot some parts of our conversation and give contridicting information.

### 3. **Over-Complicated Solutions**
Sometime over complicate things. For example, I asked for a simple layout change but got a complex CSS grid solution.

## Future Applications

### For Academic Work

**Course Projects**:
- Quick prototyping of ideas before deep diving
- Debugging complex code errors
- Understanding new libraries or frameworks
- Getting explanations of academic concepts in simpler terms

**Research**:
- Literature review assistance (summarizing papers)
- Data analysis code generation
- Writing assistance for reports

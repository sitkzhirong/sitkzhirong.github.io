Claude helped identify and fix errors quickly, explaining the root causes along the way.\n\n\n\n\nCHALLENGES\n\n\nNOT ALWAYS CORRECT ON FIRST TRY\nSome issues, like HTML rendering problems, required multiple iterations. Claude’s first suggestion didn’t always work, necessitating several alternative approaches.\n\n\nCONTEXT LIMITATIONS\nIn longer conversations, Claude occasionally forgot earlier context or provided contradictory information that conflicted with previous suggestions.\n\n\nOVER-COMPLICATED SOLUTIONS\nSometimes Claude over-engineered simple problems. For example, requesting a simple layout change resulted in an unnecessarily complex CSS grid solution."

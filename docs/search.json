    "text": "Conclusion\nThis visualization successfully transforms quantitative financial data (ages, currency amounts, interest rates) into a visual format that reveals patterns invisible in raw numbers. The line chart immediately communicates that:\n\nEarly contributions have disproportionate impact (visible in curve accumulation)\nHigher interest accounts grow significantly faster (visible in line separation)\nGrowth accelerates exponentially over time (visible in steepening curves)\n\nThe key achievement: converting hundreds of individual numeric calculations into a single comprehensible story about the mathematical power of compound interest and the importance of early financial planning."
